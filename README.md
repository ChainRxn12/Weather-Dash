### Project Overview

* The goal of this application was to create a weather application that could display current and five day forecasted weather for a specific city using OpenWeatherMap APIs.

* The Weather-DASH displays the city name, date, an icon representation of of weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.

* The UV index is color coded to show when conditions are good, fair, and severe 

* Users can input a city name to search and the search will be saved for future use with a list of previously visited cites--and cleared out with a clear button.

* The user's events will be saved even upon refreshing.
